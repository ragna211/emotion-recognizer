# emotion-recognizer
This is a simple emotion recognizer program, that can judge your emotion in real time using webcam.
90/25 images are used for training/testing. 
CNN is used in training the model with the images of different emotions 
Also, haar cascades are used so as to make sure that we are focussing on face only in the whole photo.
It basically finds human face in photo. Also, training and testing images were cropped using cascades.
